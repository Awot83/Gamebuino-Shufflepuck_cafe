I wanted to render the graphics of the Macintosh version i used to play as a kid, and it wasn't easy with the 88x48 pixels resolution :D
This is not a game, it's more an interactive pixel art animation

Full play of the Macintosh version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di8P3skzq2A

Functions :
- Each characters and the cantina have 3 different states,
- Characters are loop animated, but you can press A to pass to the next state
- First step is the cantina with all characteres exposed, press LEFT to see the 1rst character.
- Then press LEFT and RIGHT to change characters,
- Press B to go back to the cantina
